# Sino_viewer
A sinogram viewer for interfiles. 

This is a simple (so far) sinogram viewer, based on QT5 supporting interfiles. The [STIR toolkit](https://github.com/UCL/STIR) 
is the backend for the projection data and [QWT](http://qwt.sourceforge.net/) is used for the plotting. 

## Warning (22/12/17) 
The CMake file is still a bit of a mess, so please be sure the you have installed STIR and QWT before hand.
