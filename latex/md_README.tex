A sinogram viewer for Projection Data.

This is a simple (so far) sinogram viewer, based on Q\+T5 supporting projection data from Positron Emission Tomography (P\+ET) scanners. The \href{https://github.com/UCL/STIR}{\tt S\+T\+IR toolkit} is the backend for reading the projection data and \href{http://qwt.sourceforge.net/}{\tt Q\+WT} is used for the plotting.



{\itshape {\bfseries Warning (22/12/17)}} $\ast$$\ast$\+The C\+Make file is still a bit of a mess, so please be sure the you have installed S\+T\+IR and Q\+WT before hand. $\ast$$\ast$

\subsection*{Installation}

\subsubsection*{Linux systems}

\paragraph*{Dependencies}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Download and compile the git version of S\+T\+IR. This stable version at sourceforge has not been tested.
\item Either install on a global location (e.\+g. {\ttfamily /usr/local}) or define your custome location in {\ttfamily \$\+P\+A\+TH}.
\item Download and install Q\+WT $\ast$$\ast$$>$v.\+6.\+xx$\ast$$\ast$, preferably in a global location (some distributions provide packages for this).
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

$\ast$\+These are the only two dependencies. All other in the C\+M\+A\+K\+E\+L\+I\+S\+T\+S.\+txt will be dropped. In one of the next commits. $\ast$ \paragraph*{Sino\+\_\+viewer}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Clone the repository \href{https://github.com/NikEfth/sino_viewer}{\tt Sino\+\_\+viewer}.
\item {\bfseries warning} for the time being, if you have not installed S\+T\+IR on a global location you have to edit the C\+M\+A\+K\+E\+L\+I\+S\+T\+S.\+txt. Replace the S\+T\+IR path from the current to the one on your system.
\item If Q\+WT is global it will be detected automatically.
\item Create a new folder {\ttfamily sino\+\_\+viewer.\+build} outside the main folder of the project.
\item Go to {\ttfamily sino\+\_\+viewer.\+build} and run {\ttfamily ccmake \mbox{[}S\+O\+U\+R\+C\+E\+\_\+\+P\+A\+TH\mbox{]}}.
\item {\ttfamily make all}
\item (optionally) {\ttfamily make install}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsubsection*{Other OP systems}

No idea, really!

\subsubsection*{How to use}

\paragraph*{Load sinogram}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Use the {\ttfamily File \+:\+: Open Projection Data} option and select a Interfile header file (.hs). {\itshape As S\+T\+IR framework expands in the future, any supported file types (that is stored as Proj\+Data) will be, probably automatically, supported}.
\item A pop-\/up window will appear to allow to select between sinogram and viewgram view mode. Once selected this cannot change. The control widgets will be updated to the appropriate sizes.
\item Different number of viewports are supported.
\item Colormaps can be selected. 
\item A slider bar is used for scrolling between the positions.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\paragraph*{Save a sinogram}

Any sinogram can be saved either as image file (P\+NG) or as interfile (.hv \& .v). By right click on the sinogram, a context menu will appear.
